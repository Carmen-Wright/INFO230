-javascript: syntax is like java 
-scripting language is no compilation but only interpretation by JS engine in web browser
- var x - 1;
- x is visible globally 
let y=2; accessible locally 
- javascript can be embedded in a HTML document or stand only but linked to css 
-syntax between python and java not strong 
- function frame(x,y)
{
	return x + y;
}
-var frame = function(x,y)
{
	return x + y;
}
let I=100;
I % 2;  <===> I = I%2;
I += 3; <===> I = I+3;
don't say I equals I+3;
